# odin-recipes
This is a practice lesson where I show what I learned through the HTML lessons by Odin Project.
Things that I learned:
    - set up a basic HTML document
    - what is the difference between tags and elements
    - HTML elements, and how to use them
    - self closing elements
    - how to link an URL or local path
    - how to insert images

I should create a web page that shows different recipes, make links to them so users can find them
